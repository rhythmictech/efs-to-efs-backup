# efs-to-efs-backup
[EFS-to-EFS-backup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/efs-to-efs-backup/welcome.html) implemented in Terraform for use in regions where CloudFormation doesn't yet support EFS

Restore is not yet implemented. You can find the restore documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/efs-to-efs-backup/restore.html) but the CloudFormation template will likely need slight modification due to naming changes
